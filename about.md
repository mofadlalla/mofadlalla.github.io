Hi, I'm **Mohamed Fadlalla**.

I am a **Software Engineer at Google** based in **Brooklyn, NY**.

I specialize in full-stack architecture and system design, with a particular focus on solving scaling challenges. My background is in **Computer Information Systems (CIS)** from the **University of New Hampshire**, where I learned that the best code is the code you don't have to write—but the second best is the code that scales effortlessly.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building

By day, I work on large-scale distributed systems. By night, I am an indie hacker building tools that bridge the gap between code and creativity.

Currently, I am building a **Cloud-Native Video Engine** for programmatic animation. It uses **Docker-in-Docker** isolation and **AI** to allow developers to generate complex mathematical animations (using Manim) directly from the browser.

### 🚀 Past Projects

- **PageFlow:** A tool for automated PDF generation using Puppeteer and Node.js.
- **SaaS Experiments:** I explore various micro-SaaS ideas, focusing on automation and developer tooling.

### 🌎 The Personal Side

When I'm not pushing commits, I am usually:

- Exploring the **Brooklyn** food scene (always hunting for the best Mexican food).
- Traveling internationally (most recently **Egypt**).
- Training for my next fitness goal.

### 📫 Connect

I love chatting with other engineers and founders. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about **SaaS**, **System Design**, or **Docker scaling**.
